# Gearbox Reliability Analysis
The primary goal of this analysis was to examine various time-series datasets provided by NREL's gearbox testing. These datasets include conditions such as static and dynamic loading, power shutdown events, grid disconnects, and scenarios of generator misalignment to assess reliability. An ensemble model, combining an LSTM neural network with an Isolation Forest algorithm, was implemented to detect anomalies. These anomalies, indicative of abnormal gearbox behaviour, are crucial as they can signal a heightened risk of gearbox failure.
